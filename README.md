## Some notes while in Hackathon

1- the .ipynb file have all the code for stiching the images, sending the images to llama and getting the response back. you can view the prompts too in the .txt file.

also the pictures are in the folder.
the pictures are of ielts book 19 test 3 reading section.

2- new work, after extracting the passage i have pre-processed the passage and sent it to llm again to genearate a csv for vocabulary that is vivid. the idea is to showcase this csv on the front end.
